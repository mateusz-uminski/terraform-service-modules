This repository serves as a collection of Terraform modules that I use for configuring test environments, learning and verifying unconventional ideas.

Besides the README.md further documentation can be found in commits, code comments and nested README files.

Feel free to explore and utilize any content you find useful. Enjoy!

## Module naming convention
The name of each module should start with the name of the service it is designed for. For instance:
- Modules related to github should have the prefix `github-`
- Modules related to grafana should have the prefix `grafana-`
- Modules related to hashicorp consul should have the prefix `consul-`
